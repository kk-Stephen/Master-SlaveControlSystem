# Feasibility Testing

## Relationship between the angle of the reflection plane and the difference of bumper sensors

Purpose: Determine whether or not the difference of the bumper sensor will be linearly related to the angle of the reflection plane.

Methods: Rotate the reflective plane counterclockwise from 0 to 90 degrees and record the sensor difference.

Result: From 0 to 70 degrees, the sensor's difference is linearly related to the magnitude of the angle of rotation of the reflective plane.

## Recognizability of turnaround signals from leaders

Purpose: Determine if the follower's sensors can distinguish between the infrared emitted by itself and the infrared emitted by the leader.

Methods: Rotate the leader robot and record the sensors values of follower.

Result: When the follower receives infrared light emitted by the leader, the value of its sensors are much lower.
